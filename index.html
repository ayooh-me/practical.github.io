Key Adjustments:
Responsive Video: The video is set to width: 100% and height: auto, ensuring it scales properly across different screen sizes.
Container: Added a .container class to limit the maximum width of the content, making it look better on larger screens while still being responsive.
Padding: Added padding to the body for better spacing on smaller devices.
This setup should help the video and text fit well on all browsers and devices. Feel free to test it and make further adjustments as needed!

Monica
To ensure that the background image appears behind all text and content, you can adjust the CSS by applying the background image to the container instead of the body. Here’s the updated HTML:
